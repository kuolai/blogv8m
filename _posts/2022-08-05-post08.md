Knowing Ruby and RoR helps learning/understanding JavaScript and React.
For example, it is intimidating to learn React class components and its constructor with so many new vocabulary:

```
class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}
```

But if you know Ruby, the code in Ruby will look like:

```
class Car << React.Component
  color = 'red'
  '<h2>I am a Car!</h2>'
end
```

You get to know the concept of React.Component as a class and go on the learn other React parts.
And you can pick up constructor(), super(), this.state, and render() later.

In addition to RoR and React skills, I have Bachelors and Master degree in computer science,
and Experience with Github (see https://kuolai.github.io/blogua10/ for a Jekyll project with Github).

I am not sure I fit into your company amazingly, but I am sure that I will enjoy working in projects
with RoR and Reacts.
